Detecting compiler hash for triplet arm64-windows...
Error: Unsupported toolchain combination.
Target was arm64 but the chosen Visual Studio instance supports:
    x86, amd64, x86_amd64, amd64_x86
Vcpkg selected C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community as the Visual Studio instance.
Detected instances:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community

See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/users/triplets.md#VCPKG_VISUAL_STUDIO_PATH for more information.
Note: Updating vcpkg by rerunning bootstrap-vcpkg may resolve this failure.
